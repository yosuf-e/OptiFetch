User Guide:

Thank you for choosing OptiFetch 2026. There are 2 ways to run the program: the easy way (through the exe file; the hard way through the python script). 

METHOD #1 (EASY): Use the EXE. File

- After unzipping the zip file, you will find an exe. file named "OptiFetch_2026.exe", you can just run the code from there and even move it to your desktop. However, if the app's logo becomes corrupted, you can try either restarting your PC/Laptop, or creating a shortcut for the app and then changing its logo in the properties menu (by selecting the "App_Logo.ico" file.)


METHOD #2 (HARD): Use the Py. File

1. Install Python
This script primarily runs on Python; thus, you will need it for both running it and making it workable. You can install it from: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install yt-dlp
This script requires the yt-dlp library. Install it via your Python directory by running:
pip install yt-dlp

3. Install FFmpeg
FFmpeg is required for processing high-quality video and audio. Install it via Windows PowerShell using:
winget install ffmpeg



Troubleshooting

- Make sure that Python is properly installed and that you have created a PATH environment.

- FFmpeg Not Found: If the application reports that FFmpeg does not exist, verify the installation by typing-- ffmpeg -version or winget list -- in your terminal. If it is not listed, please repeat the installation step above.

- Module Errors: If you encounter a ModuleNotFoundError regarding yt-dlp, verify that it is installed in your active Python environment by typing 
pip show yt-dlp

- After installing FFmpeg, you may need to restart your terminal or computer for the changes to take effect.

- Update Command: In 2026, APIs change frequently; thus, if downloads fail, try updating your library with: 
pip install -U yt-dlp

- Check Python Version: Ensure you are on a modern version (Python 3.10 or higher for compatibility)

- Admin Rights: If winget fails run PowerShell as Administrator to install system-level dependencies.
